# PiPhi Network pfSense

Monitoring-first PiPhi Network integration for pfSense firewalls running the community
[pfSense REST API v2](https://pfrest.org/). The runtime polls firewall health,
interfaces, gateways, services, and optionally DHCP/VPN status, then publishes
normalized PiPhi entities, telemetry, transition events, and an overview widget.

The integration never modifies firewall configuration, installs packages, or
executes arbitrary commands. Diagnostic ping, service start/restart, and
Wake-on-LAN are explicit, allow-listed actions and are disabled by default.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- A supported pfSense CE or pfSense Plus release
- The community `pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI` v2 package
- HTTPS connectivity from the PiPhi runtime to the pfSense management address
- A dedicated API key with only the endpoint privileges enabled below

Required pfSense API access:

- `GET /api/v2/status/system`
- `GET /api/v2/system/version`
- `GET /api/v2/system/restapi/version`
- `GET /api/v2/status/interfaces`
- `GET /api/v2/status/gateways`
- `GET /api/v2/status/services`

Optional access is needed for DHCP leases and VPN status only when those
collection settings are enabled.

Optional action privileges:

- `api-v2-diagnostics-ping-post` for diagnostic ping
- `api-v2-status-service-post` for service start/restart
- `api-v2-services-wake-on-lan-send-post` for Wake-on-LAN

Optional monitoring privileges, enabled by their corresponding collection flags:

- `GET /api/v2/diagnostics/arp_table` and DHCP leases for client inventory
- `GET /api/v2/status/logs/{firewall,auth,dhcp,system}` for log events
- `GET /api/v2/system/certificates` for expiry metadata
- `GET /api/v2/status/carp`, `/api/v2/firewall/virtual_ips`, and
  `/api/v2/system/hasync` for high-availability monitoring

## Local development

```bash
pdm install -G dev
pdm run pytest
pdm run ruff check src tests
pdm run mypy src/piphi_network_pfsense
pdm run python scripts/validate.py
pdm run uvicorn piphi_network_pfsense.main:app --reload --port 8090
```

The development group includes `piphi-runtime-testkit-python==0.1.3`. Its
end-to-end test starts a loopback mock PiPhi Core, configures the runtime with
TestKit payload builders, validates `/entities`, and captures outbound telemetry
and transition events.

Configure the runtime through `POST /config`:

```json
{
  "id": "home-firewall",
  "host": "pfsense.example.lan",
  "api_key": "replace-with-a-least-privilege-api-key",
  "alias": "Home Firewall",
  "port": 443,
  "scheme": "https",
  "verify_tls": true,
  "poll_interval_seconds": 60,
  "collect_dhcp_leases": false,
  "collect_vpn_status": false,
  "collect_client_inventory": true,
  "collect_security_logs": true,
  "collect_certificates": true,
  "collect_ha_status": false,
  "enable_diagnostic_ping": true,
  "allowed_ping_hosts": ["1.1.1.1", "gateway.example.lan"],
  "enable_service_restart": true,
  "enable_service_start": true,
  "allowed_services": ["unbound"],
  "enable_wake_on_lan": true,
  "wake_on_lan_targets": [
    {
      "id": "office-pc",
      "label": "Office PC",
      "interface": "lan",
      "mac_addr": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
    }
  ]
}
```

`host` accepts a hostname or IP address, not a URL. HTTPS and certificate
verification are enabled by default. For an internal CA, mount its PEM bundle
into the container and set `ca_bundle_path`. HTTP requires both `scheme=http`
and `verify_tls=false` and should only be used in an isolated lab.

## Runtime model

Each configured firewall becomes a `network_gateway` entity. Live interfaces,
routing gateways, and OpenVPN/IPsec/WireGuard tunnels become child entities with
stable IDs. Interface byte counters are converted into receive/transmit bit
rates after the first sample. No VPN keys are projected into PiPhi state.

The runtime exposes the standard PiPhi endpoints, including `/health`,
`/diagnostics`, `/discover`, `/config`, `/entities`, `/state`, and `/command`.
`refresh` performs an immediate read-only poll. `diagnostic_ping` accepts only
targets in `allowed_ping_hosts`. `restart_service` accepts only services in
`allowed_services`; `start_service` uses the same allowlist. `wake_on_lan`
accepts only a configured target ID, keeping its interface and MAC immutable to
the caller. Service operations require confirmation and prevent multi-firewall
fanout. Every operational action must be enabled independently.

Gateway, interface, and service up/down transitions are delivered as Runtime
SDK integration events and exposed as behavior triggers. The widget source is
under `widgets/pfsense-overview`. A second client/security widget displays
inventory, certificate alerts, and recent log volume. Run `npm ci && npm run
conformance` in either widget directory for local validation.

Log collection establishes the first response as its baseline and emits only
new entries afterward. Certificate responses are stripped down to description,
type, and validity fields immediately; certificate bodies, CSRs, CA references,
and private keys are never retained in normalized snapshots or PiPhi state.

Action idempotency results are stored in `/data/piphi/automation-actions.sqlite3`.
The manifest mounts `/var/lib/piphi/pfsense` there so a container restart cannot
silently repeat a previously completed service operation.

Optional endpoint failures do not discard the system snapshot. They are
reported under `endpoint_errors` in state and diagnostics so a least-privilege
API key can be expanded deliberately rather than requiring administrator
access.

## Container

```bash
docker build -t piphinetwork/piphi-network-pfsense:0.1.0 .
```

The container does not require host networking, privileged mode, or access to
the pfSense filesystem.

## Releases

Create and push a semantic version tag such as `v0.1.0`, then dispatch the
Release workflow from `main` with that tag as `release_ref`. Running the
workflow from `main` matches the Docker Hub OIDC trust policy, while every
build and verification step checks out the immutable tag. The tag must match
`manifest.json`, `pyproject.toml`, the runtime version constant, the Docker Hub
image reference, and both widget package/manifest versions. A passing release
publishes multi-platform `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` images to
`piphinetwork/piphi-network-pfsense`, generates provenance and an SBOM, and
creates a GitHub Release containing Python distributions, the packaged
integration, and SHA-256 checksums.

Docker Hub authentication uses its GitHub Actions OIDC connection. Configure
the organization variable `DOCKERHUB_OIDC_CONNECTIONID` with visibility for
this repository and the connection ID for the `piphinetwork` organization; the
workflow does not use a Docker Hub password or long-lived access token.

## Upstream status

The pfSense REST API package is community maintained and is not supported by
Netgate. Its compatibility is tied to specific pfSense releases. Validate the
package/firewall version combination in a non-production environment before
deployment.
